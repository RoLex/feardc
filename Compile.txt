= Compiling FearDC


1.	Application and Dependency versions needed

		Some tools can be found on <https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus/files/Dev/>,
		although I recommend getting them directly from their hosts.

		* A modern C++ compiler. We are currently using these 2 packages by the MinGW-w64 project for official releases:
		- 64-bit: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z>
		- 32-bit: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/dwarf/i686-8.1.0-release-win32-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0.7z>

		Make sure that the compiler's "bin" directory is in your PATH environment variable.

		Have a look at section 2 for additional steps to configure the compiler.
		Have a look at section 4 for alternative compilers.

		* Python - 3.5+
		<https://www.python.org>
		Make sure that Python is in your PATH environment variable.

		* SCons - 4.x.x
		<https://scons.org/pages/download.html>

		Note: SCons relies on Python so you need to have Python installed first.

		On Windows you can install scons from the Python Package Index (PyPi) only.
		The "python -m pip install scons" command installs scons into the Python\Scripts folder.

		Make sure that SCons is in your PATH environment variable. 

		* Perl - 5.12.0.1 or later (from MSYS, Cygwin or ActivePerl; only needed to build help files)
		<https://www.perl.org/get.html>

		Make sure that Perl is in your PATH environment variable.

		* gettext runtime & tools - 0.17 or later
		<https://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/>

		Make sure that the gettext tools are in your PATH environment variable.

		* Html Help Workshop (only needed to build help files)
		<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985%28VS.85%29.aspx>

		Make sure that hhc.exe is in your PATH environment variable.

		* asciidoc3 (only needed to build help files)
		<https://pypi.org/project/asciidoc3/#files>

		Make sure that asciidoc3 is in your PATH environment variable.

		* NSIS - 3.0 or later (only needed to build the installer)
		<https://nsis.sourceforge.io>

		After installing NSIS, download the CPUFeatures plug-in from <https://nsis.sourceforge.io/CPUFeatures_plug-in>.
		From the .zip archive you have to unpack the following files:
		 - Plugins\Release_Unicode\CPUFeatures.dll to <NSIS installation folder>\Plugins\x86-unicode\
		 - Include\CPUFeatures.nsh to <NSIS installation folder>\Include\

		Make sure that makensis.exe is in your PATH environment variable.

		* zip from MSYS / Cygwin or 7-Zip (only needed to build the official distro)

		Make sure that zip is in your PATH environment variable.


2. Specific configuration of the compiler

	a. HTML Help support (only for MinGW)

		To build a version with HTML Help support, copy the following files from a Windows SDK
		(Windows SDK path -> FearDC source code path):
		Include/shared/winapifamily.h -> mingw/include/winapifamily.h
		Include/um/HtmlHelp.h -> mingw/include/htmlhelp.h
		Lib/win8/um/x86/Htmlhelp.Lib -> mingw/lib/htmlhelp.lib
		Lib/win8/um/x64/Htmlhelp.Lib -> mingw/lib/x64/htmlhelp.lib

		The latest Windows SDK is currently at
		<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/desktop/hh852363>; it installs into
		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0".

	b. OpenSSL

		Download OpenSSL from www.openssl.org, copy the 'openssl-*.tar.gz' archive to the openssl/build folder.

		Compiling with MinGW

			Use the build_mingw.bat script provided in the openssl/build folder. It will copy the compiled libraries to openssl/lib.
			The build process needs Cygwin installed. Above the basic (default) packages the following additional packages needs
			to be installed under Cygwin:

			* perl (Perl builds for Windows are unsuitable for this process)
			* make

			<https://bennierobinson.com/programming/2016/01/24/perl-windows-2016.html> explains how to set up these
			packages in detail.

			You'll also need a GNU Patch executable for the operation in your PATH. It can be either the GNU Win32 binary
			or a package installed under Cygwin or even any patch executable that may come with your versioning system.

			Make sure that Cygwin's 'bin' folder is in your PATH environment variable.

		Compiling with MSVC

			Compilation requires the following additional packages to be installed above MSVS 2022:

			* Perl v5.32.1 or later (from Strawberry [tested] or ActiveState)
			  <https://www.perl.org/get.html>

			* NASM version 2.15 or later
			  <https://www.nasm.us>

			Make sure both tools' executables are added in your PATH environment variable.

			For generating the 64-bit library open [x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022] prompt and run:
				perl Configure no-shared no-capieng -DOPENSSL_SYS_WIN32 -DOPENSSL_NO_CAPIENG VC-WIN64A --prefix=%CD%

			For generating the 32-bit library open [x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022] prompt and run:
				perl Configure no-shared no-capieng -DOPENSSL_SYS_WIN32 -DOPENSSL_NO_CAPIENG VC-WIN32 --prefix=%CD%

			Then run:
				nmake
			which will compile the makefile and generate your libs and
				nmake install_sw
			This will move all of your libs to the path specified in --openssldir switch

		You may also ask around for help and pre-compiled libs in the DCDev hub; someone might have already built a package.


3. Starting the build process

	Open a command prompt and type "scons" followed by some options:

		"tools=mingw" - Use mingw for building (default)
		"tools=default" - Use msvc for building (yes, the option value is strange)
		"mode=debug" - Compile a debug build (default)
		"mode=release" - Compile an optimized release build
		"arch=x64" - Compile a 64-bit build

		To see more options, type "scons tools=mingw -h".

		Tip: You can create a file custom.py and put your options in there.

		You can choose which targets to build; eg:
		  scons build/debug-mingw/dwt
		will only build DWT with MinGW in debug mode. By default, when no target is specified, SCons builds all targets.
		For more possible arguments, consult the SCons manual.

		If you have problems, use google. It works for me.

		Example: scons tools=mingw mode=release arch=x64 i18n=yes help=yes prefix=x86_64-w64-mingw32-


4. Alternative compilers

	a. Various versions of MinGW (GCC 8.1 or later):
	<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/>
	<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/>

		We recommend using compilers from the MinGW-w64 project. All you have to do to use one is
		download it and extract it.
		Prefer DWARF versions (usually marked with a "-dw") of 32-bit compilers; SJLJ ones should
		be avoided for performance reasons.

		We are currently using these 2 packages by the MinGW-w64 project:
		- 64-bit: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z>
		- 32-bit: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/dwarf/i686-8.1.0-release-win32-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0.7z>

		To install compilers from regular MinGW (not MinGW-w64), the easiest way is to use
		mingw-get. Extract it to C:\MinGW and run:
			mingw-get install gcc g++
		A graphical installer around mingw-get is also available to facilitate the above.
		Note that building FearDC with MinGW (not MinGW-w64) is not often tested and may lead to
		stability issues.

		Make sure that MinGW\bin is in your PATH environment variable.

		Alternatively, if you have Cygwin, a MinGW compiler can be installed as part of Cygwin:
		select it in the "Devel" category when running the Cygwin installer.
		To make FearDC use it, add "prefix=i686-pc-mingw32-" to the scons arguments or create a
		custom.py file containing:
			prefix='i686-pc-mingw32-'
		Make sure that Cygwin\bin is in your PATH environment variable.
		Note that building with MinGW compilers provided by Cygwin is not often tested.

	b. Microsoft Visual Studio 2022:
		<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022>

		To generate project files for MSVC, run "scons" with "msvcproj=1" and "tools=default".
		The resulting solution file (DCPlusPlus.sln) will be in msvc/[mode-arch]/.


5.  Other information and submitting patches

		a. With doxygen, graphviz and some luck, you can use the supplied doxygen configuration
		file to generate some nice docs. Just check that the paths in the doxyfile are correct.

		b. In the event you experience crashing you can check the howto guide for debugging
		at <https://answers.launchpad.net/dcplusplus/+faq/337>

		Note that FearDC.exe is stripped by default when it has been built with MinGW;
		debugging symbols instead reside in FearDC.pdb. To get GDB to swallow it, start it with
		the following command:
			gdb -e FearDC.exe -s FearDC.pdb

		c. Linux / Unix:

			Look at <https://launchpad.net/linuxdcpp> for the *nix port of DC++ - they'll gladly accept any help. 	

		d. Submitting patches

			If you think you've done something that more people could use, you can always submit a
			patch for inclusion in the original distribution. I will then consider whether I like
			the patch or not based on things that might seem to be completely random, which just
			might be the case. Popular reasons for rejecting a patch include, but are not limited
			to, ugly code, abusable features, features that I don't like that bloat the application
			and incompatibility with other modifications I've already done.

			The Mercurial code repository is at <https://sourceforge.net/p/dcplusplus/code/>.

			We accept both plain patches and pull requests.

		e. Licensing issues with submitted patches	

			In order to avoid future licensing issues, I ask you to give me copyright over any submitted code. 
			If you don't like this policy, you are free to start your own distribution (as
			many have done), and if you're lucky it might become more popular than the original =). Please
			state explicitly when submitting the patch that you give me copyright over the code if the submission is larger 
			than trivial.

		f. Developing plugins

			The DC plugin SDK is at <https://launchpad.net/dc-plugin-sdk>.

			See dcpp/Plugin* files for implementation details.

			The "Plugin format (dcext).txt" document describes the way plugins are packaged.
