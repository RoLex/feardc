<h1>How to unblock DC++ in firewalls and other installed security software?</h1>

<p>Under Windows, using security software and certain operating system features to prevent the computer
from various attacks and security hazards is a common and highly recommended 
practice. However, any misconfigured security feature can cause cause problems using DC++
ranging from partial feature blocking to a complety blocked network access.
If you experience connection problems (can't connect to <b>any</b> hub or download <b>any</b> hublist,
file transfers aren't possible in any direction, <b>neither downloads nor uploads</b>) 
<u>while your other installed programs are able to access the Internet without problems</u> 
then it's possible that something blocks DC++.</p>

<p>Whether it is the operating system's built-in firewall or any installed 3rd party security
software that keeps DC++ from work, you must find out why's the blocking and how to unblock DC++.</p>

<h2>Signs of blocking</h2>
<p>You might suspect that DC++ is blocked if you experience any combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>you are unable to connect to any hub</li>
	<li>you can't download any hublist</li>
	<li>no file transfers (neither uploads nor downloads)</li>
	<li>weird messages at start complaining about unable to open ports</li>
	<li>cannot start DC++ itself at all</li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to check if DC++ is blocked is to go the Help/About menu in
DC++ and check if it can download the Latest Version number (bottom box of the
window). A version number should appear in the box soon. If you get error
message instead it means something is preventing DC++ from accessing the
Internet.</p>

<p><u>Important:</u> If you have problems with <b>searches and/or file downloads only</b>, 
while uploads and other functions are working properly then most likely the problem is with
the <a href="settings_connectivity.html">connectivity settings</a> instead. While it does not
hurt to go on with this FAQ and check if DC++ is properly allowed in various places, if the 
case above applies to you, you may solve the problem sooner if you follow the
<a href="faq_connection.html">Connection setup guide</a> instead.</p>

<h2>What OS components or software can block DC++?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Windows internal firewall</li>
	<li>3rd party firewall software</li>
	<li>Anti-virus software</li>
	<li>Anti-spyware software</li>
	<li>Security suites with features combined of the above</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting Windows built-in firewall</h2>

<p>The firewall component included in recent Windows operating systems is enabled by default. While it does not offer a plethora of options, its suitable to use by itself for protection. If it's enabled and you have problems accessing the Internet with DC++ the best practice is to check for and delete existing exception(s) for DC++ then let the operating system properly readd it at next start of the DC++ application. To do this, close DC++ and
<ul> 
  <li><u>in Windows 7 or later</u>:
go to Control Panel -&gt; Windows Firewall -&gt; Allow a program or feature through Windows Firewall. Select DC++ and click Remove.
  </li>
</ul>
Start DC++ again and if a firewall popup window appears asking permission for DC++, click Allow.
</p>

<p>If the above doesn't help its wise to enable logging of packets that the firewall drops for troubleshooting DC++ (or any other applications') access. To do this,
<ul>
  <li><u>in Windows 7 and later</u>:
go to Control Panel -&gt; Windows Firewall -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Monitoring -&gt; Firewall. You can browse the firewall events here in great detail.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Unblock DC++ in various 3rd party security software</h2>

<p>The method for unblocking programs in 3rd party security software varies from product to product.
Check the program's help or manual for proper instructions. The best general practice is to
exit DC++ and remove ALL the rules for DC++ in the appropriate configuration place of your 
security software. If you run a complete security suite you may have to unblock DC++ in more parts
of the application (eg. in the firewall part and the application control part).</p>

<p>After deleting the rules restart DC++. In most cases you'll be shown a popup window or a taskbar
alert from the security software where you can properly enable (make an exception rule for) DC++.</p>

<p>Some additional tips:
<ul>
	<li>Almost all anti-virus suites (Norton 360, McAfee, CA, Eset, Kaspersky, F-Secure, AVG, etc.) include a firewall
component with their "typical" install method. Because of this, you can still have a firewall running even if you've 
never installed a separate firewall product or seen a sign of its operation.</li>

	<li>If you use a third party software firewall or securty suite then make 
sure you have the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/firewall-and-network-protection-in-the-windows-security-app-ec0844f7-aebd-0583-67fe-601ecf5d774f" target="_blank" class="external">internal Windows firewall disabled</a> although 
on modern Windows versions your 3rd party firewall application most likely able to successfully disable the internal firewall automatically.</li>

</ul>
