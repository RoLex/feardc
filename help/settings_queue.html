<h1>Queue settings</h1>
<h2>Auto priority settings</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTOPRIO">
Autoprio allows setting the queue item priority automatically when
adding it to the download queue. A user can then change the priority of
a file manually.<br/>
Priority conditions are checked from the Highest to the Lowest
priority, when assigning a priority to a new queue item. A zero means
that the given priority level won't be used - except Normal priority,
which is the default priority. Lowest possible value for the Highest
priority is 16 KiB.
</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Highest prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_HIGHEST">Files with the same or under the entered size will be set to
Highest as priority. (default: 64 KiB) </dd>
  <dt>Normal prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_NORMAL">Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest
and High prio max size, will be set to Normal as priority. (default: 0
KiB) </dd>
  <dt>High prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_HIGH">Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest
prio max size, will be set to High as priority. (default: 0 KiB)</dd>
  <dt>Low prio max size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_LOW">Files with the same or under the entered size, but above Highest,
High and Normal prio max size, will be set to Low as priority.
(default: 0 KiB)</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="autodrop">Autodrop settings</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP">
Autodrop allows automatical removal (or disconnecting) of slow download
sources. By default, slow sources are removed.<br/>
All of these autodrop options are necessary to estimate and
disconnect/drop sources properly.
</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Drop sources below x B/s</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_SPEED">If the download speed of a file is below the entered value, the
source will be dropped. (default: 1024 B/s) </dd>
  <dt>Min elapsed</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_ELAPSED">Amount of time (in seconds) that has to pass since the download
started before a source can be dropped. (default: 15 s) </dd>
  <dt>Min sources online</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_MINSOURCES">Minimum amount of sources before any sources will be dropped.
(default: 1) </dd>
  <dt>Check every x s</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_INTERVAL">Check every x second(s) if the source is slow. (default: 10 s) </dd>
  <dt>Max inactivity</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_INACTIVITY">This is the maximal time since the last chunk of data for the
file was recieved. It is meant to improve speed measurement accuracy
and to prevent dropping sources that are going to be disconnected only
because of their current inactivity. (default: 10 s) </dd>
  <dt>Min filesize</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_FILESIZE">Minimum filesize before sources will be dropped (in KiB).
(default: 0 KiB)</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Other queue options</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Set lowest prio for newly added files larger than Low prio size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_PRIO_LOWEST">With this enabled, files that are larger than Low prio max size
are set to Lowest as priority. If disabled, the files will be set to
Normal as priority. </dd>
  <dt>Autodrop slow sources for all queue items (except filelists)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_ALL">
This option removes the slow sources for all queue items (except
file lists).<br/>
To enable autodrop, turn on either "Autodrop slow sources for all queue
items" or "Remove slow file lists" (or both of them).
</dd>
  <dt>Remove slow filelists</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_FILELISTS">
With this option enabled, DC++ will delete a file list whose speed
was recognized as too slow.<br/>
To enable autodrop, turn on either "Autodrop slow sources for all queue
items" or "Remove slow file lists" (or both of them).
</dd>
  <dt>Don't remove the source when autodropping, only disconnect</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTODROP_DISCONNECT">With this option enabled, sources will only be disconnected but
not removed from the queue.</dd>
  <dt id="autosearchdl">Automatically search for alternative download locations</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTO_SEARCH">Every few minutes, the client will search for files in your
Download Queue to find more download locations (more users/sources).
The autosearch will find exact matches by searching via hash. 
<i>
The drawback is that it may won't find much more sources and will prevent 
manual searches on hubs where a predefined search interval rule is in effect.
</i> To avoid constant auto searches you can set the maximal number of sources that files can have
when you specify a number in <a href="settings_expert.html#autosearchlimit">Auto search limit</a> setting.
</dd>
  <dt id="automatchqueue">Automatically match queue for search hits</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_AUTO_SEARCH_AUTO_MATCH">Enable to automatically download a user's list and match them as
sources for files in your Download Queue when they've been discovered
as a source for one of the files you're downloading. If you download
files in sets, that user is probably a source for many more files
you're downloading. <i>Enable if unsure.
The drawbacks are that it might add slower sources, possibly increasing
the time needed to complete a download, and that you'll download a lot
of file lists.</i></dd>
  <dt>Skip zero-byte files</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_SKIP_ZERO_BYTE">When this option is enabled, any zero byte files you try to
download will be silently skipped. Sometimes empty files contain
information through their naming. However every file, even an empty
one, will consume some drive space.</dd>
  <dt id="alreadyshared">Don't download files already in share</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_DONT_DL_ALREADY_SHARED">This option will stop you from downloading files which already
exist in one of your shared directories. When you enable this function, to get already shared items removed from the
queue you have to restart DC++.</dd>
  <dt>Don't download files already in the queue</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_DONT_DL_ALREADY_QUEUED">This option will stop you from downloading files which already
exist in your queue by blocking the addition of the same file to a different place in the queue. The comparsion is made
by TTH and not by the name or the size of the file. Even though the addition is blocked the possible new sources will still 
be aquired and added to the existing file in the queue. If the file already exists in the queue and no new sources found either
then a &quot;File is already in the queue&quot; message will be shown.</dd>
  <dt id="keepfinished">Keep finished files in the queue</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_QUEUE_KEEP_FINISHED_FILES">Enable this option if you want to keep downloaded files and folders
in the download queue after they have been finished. After downloaded the queue items will have 'Finished' status and you
can delete these finished entries anytime later. Using this function you can keep track of what files are already downloaded
right there in the download queue without the need of checking the <a href="window_finished_downloads.html">Finished Downloads</a>
window. Note that if you physically move/delete your downloaded files from their target location, it won't result automatic deletion 
of the corresponding finished entries from the queue. If you disable this function, it won't remove existing finished items from
the queue either, you must do that manually.</dd>
