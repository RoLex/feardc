as a status line in main chat instead of in a separate window. This
could cause you to miss some messages if you don't check the chat
regularly. <i>You may not care much for
private messages from other users. Ignoring them however, not only
lessens the (user-friendly) Direct Connect experience, but is not
always wise because failing to reply to a message from an Operator can
get you kicked or, in the worst case, permanently banned from that hub.</i></dd>
