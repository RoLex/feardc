	<h1>Connectivity<br/>
		Manual configuration
	</h1>
<p>
Use these settings to manually configure DC++ for incoming connections. If unsure about these settings, 
you may want to follow the <a href="faq_connection.html">Manual connection setup guide</a>.
While some settings as various <i>Ports</i> are shared, the rest are grouped making possible to individually
set and fine tune connectivity for IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Settings on this pane are unavailabe and ignored 
when <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> is enabled.
Note that IPv6 support is currently in experimental state and DC++ might not able to connect to all kinds
of DC clients using the IPv6 protocol.
</p>
<p>Before changing these make sure you are familiar with the meaning of each connection mode and with the <a href="faq_whyactive.html">differences between active and passive mode and their effect on your ability to 
search and download from users</a> of the DC network.

	<dd><p>These settings specify the communication ports DC++ listens on for incoming connections.
	Generally you don't need to add specific ports unless you configured your port forwarding settings
	manually. If port settings are left blank, DC++ will let the operating system generate a random

<h2 id="connection">Individual settings for IPv4 and IPv6 protocols</h2>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The following incoming connection settings grouped to be able to 
	do a separate setup for the two available IP protocols.</p>
	
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>Active mode (I have no router / I have configured my router)</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_ACTIVE">
	Select this mode if you are directly connected to the Internet (no router) or if you are
	willing to manually configure port forwarding rules in your router. Use this mode only if the
	automatic configuration (via NAT-PMP / UPnP) is not an option for you. For more information,
	refer to the <a href="faq_portforward.html">Manual port forwarding guide</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Active mode (let DC++ configure my router with NAT-PMP / UPnP)</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_UPNP">
	Select this mode if you are behind a router that supports standard port forwarding methods such
	as NAT-PMP or UPnP. Most routers do support them but they often have to be explicitly enabled
	from the router's configuration page. Thanks to automatic port mapping methods, DC++ is able to
	open the ports it needs and obtain your external IP address as well. For more information, see
	<a href="faq_mapping.html">What is NAT-PMP / UPnP?</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Passive mode (last resort - has serious limitations)</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_PASSIVE">
	Select this mode if you can't get active mode to work. In this mode, DC++ will not try to
	listen for inbound connections; it will only initiate outbound ones. This mode carries some
	serious limitations:
	<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<li>only 5 results per user will be returned in response to searches.</li>
		<li>you may not be able to download / receive search results from passive users.</li>
		<li>you may not be able to fully enjoy certain hubs (because of their regulations).</li>
	</ul>
	Note that DC++ tries NAT Traversal on ADC hubs to allow passive users to connect with each other.
	</dd>

	<dt>Disable connectivity</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_DISABLE">
	Select this mode if you do not wish to have the specified protocol active.
	</dd>

	<dt id="extip">External / WAN IP address</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_EXTERNAL_IP">
	These fields specify your external IP addresses for the specified protocol. 
	<i>Note: most hubs are able to determine your external IPs and forward it to your DC++, making 
	a manual configuration of this field unnecessary.</i> If your computer is directly connected to 
	the internet, your internal and external IP will be the same and can easily be automatically 
	detected. Fill these boxes <b>only</b> if you need to override said auto-detection. 
	Ordinarily, only users behind a router (NAT device) need to fill in this boxes. 
	If you put a DNS name here, DC++ will try to resolve it into an IP address before use. 
	For additional information like how to determine your external IP
	address, follow the <a href="faq_connection.html">Manual connection setup guide</a>.</dd>

	<dt id="noipoverride">Don't allow hubs/NAT-PMP/UPnP to override</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_OVERRIDE">
	Enable this to always use the IP address in "External / WAN IP", and not let either NAT-PMP,
	UPnP nor connected hubs change it. If unsure, leave this setting disabled.
	</dd>

	<dt id="prefmap">Preferred port mapping interface</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_MAPPER">
	DC++ has several interfaces available it can use to try to automatically map the ports it
	requires on the router:
	<ul>
		<li>NAT-PMP: A lightweight protocol that is not widely used by generic routers; but
		open-source firmwares generally implement it.</li>
		<li>MiniUPnP: An open-source UPnP library.</li>
	</ul>
	The interface selected here will be tried first; other available interfaces will then be tried
	if the preferred port mapping interface were to fail.
	</dd>

	<dt id="broaddet">Enable broad device detection</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_BROADDET">
	If the interface supports the feature, enabling this option allows a broader selection of devices to be considered for port mapping.
	It is recommended to enable this setting only if your device cannot be found using the normal detection method. The broader detection 
	method may include devices that do not fully meet the usual criteria for port mapping. For example, devices with non-standard responses, 
	firmware bugs, or those that appear on your network but report as disconnected or not properly connected to the internet may still be 
	detected this way.
	Please note that there is no guarantee that devices detected through this method will function correctly, even if port mapping appears 
	to succeed. However, this option may occasionally allow buggy, but otherwise usable devices to work with DC++.
	</dd>

	<dt id="bindaddress">Bind Address</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_BIND_ADDRESS">
	This setting allows binding DC++ network connections of the specified protocol to a specific network 
	adapter by its IP address. Useful when you have more than one physical or virtual network adapter installed and
	you want to assign a specfic device for all the network traffic generated for a certain IP protocol 
	by DC++.<br/>
	If this setting is set to 'Default' it means that DC++ is relying on the operating
	system to find the best adapter. In case of the adapter offered by the operating system does
	not suit you, you can override it here by selecting the required adapter. <br/>
	If binding with the selected adapter fails, it will do so silently and the 'Default' setting
	(INADDR_ANY) will be used instead.
