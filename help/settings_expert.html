<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Max hash speed</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_MAX_HASH_SPEED">This is the speed at which DC++ will hash your files, in
MiB/s.
It is limited by the speed of your disk subsystem, but it can be
used to make hashing slower and less noticable. A "normal" hash
speed may be anywhere from 20 to 50 MiB/s.  (no default)</dd>
  <dt>Write buffer size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_BUFFERSIZE">This controls the size of the chunks that DC++ writes to
disk for downloads. Measured in kibibytes. (default: 16 KiB)</dd>
  <dt id="autosearchlimit">Auto-search limit</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_AUTO_SEARCH_LIMIT">This will limit the amount of online sources a file can have before it will no longer be auto searched for. For example, if this option is set to 2, if a file has more than or exactly 2 sources online, the file will be excluded from the auto-search list. (default: 5 sources)</dd>
    <dt id="Dt1">Auto-search interval</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_AUTO_SEARCH_INTERVAL">This will set the time interval between auto searches. Specified in seconds and defaults to 120 seconds (cannot be lower than this).</dd>
  <dt id="minislotsize">Mini slot size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_MINISLOT_SIZE">This value defines a file size border for mini slots; a <a href="settings_sharing.html#slots">mini slot</a> will be given to peers on requesting files below this size. The minimum value for this setting is 512 KiB. (default: 512 KiB)</dd>
  <dt id="maxlistsize">Max filelist size</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_MAX_FILELIST_SIZE">This setting controls the size of the maximum file list
that DC++
will open, in mebibytes. This setting helps protect against
malformed file lists that require large amounts of memory to decode.
You may need to reduce or increase the value of this setting
based on personal experience. (default: 512 MiB)</dd>
  <dt>PID</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_PRIVATE_ID">This is your unique private ID (PID). This will later with an algorithm be used to identify you on ADC hubs. <b>Do not share this with other users.</b></dd>
  <dt id="autorefresh">Auto refresh time</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_AUTO_REFRESH_TIME">This controls the interval at which your shared directories
are rescanned for new and changed content. This is measured
in minutes. (default: 60 minutes)</dd>
  <dt>Settings save interval</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_SETTINGS_SAVE_INTERVAL">This controls the interval at which
  your settings are automatically saved; good to prevent losses in case of crashes. This is
  measured in minutes. (default: 10 minutes)</dd>
  <dt>Socket read buffer</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_SOCKET_IN_BUFFER">The size of the buffer DC++ uses to read sockets. Measured
in bytes. (default: operating system default)</dd>
  <dt id="writebuffer">Socket write buffer</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_SOCKET_OUT_BUFFER">The size of the buffer DC++ uses to write to sockets.
  Measured in bytes. (default: operating system default)</dd>
  <dt>Max PM windows</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_MAX_PM_WINDOWS">
  The maximum amount of <placeholder><a href="window_pm.html">Private Message</a></placeholder>
  windows that are allowed to be opened at the same time. (default: 50)<br/>
  When a <placeholder><a href="window_pm.html">Private Message</a></placeholder> window can't be
  opened because this setting would not be satisfied, the chat message that spawned it will be
  shown in its originating <placeholder><a href="window_hub.html">Hub</a></placeholder> window
  instead.
  </dd>
  <dt id="maxcommandlength">Max protocol command length</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH">The amount of protocol data DC++ will maximally manage. This setting help protect against potentially malicious clients and hubs.
  Measured in bytes. (default: 524288 bytes)</dd>
    <dt id="whitelistedopenuris">Whitelisted URIs to open</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_EXPERT_WHITELIST_OPEN_URIS">URIs to automatically open without a security prompt. Use semicolon to separate multiple URIs. Default is http:;https:;www;mailto:</dd>
