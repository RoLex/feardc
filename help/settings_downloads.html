<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>This page contains the configuration options for where DC++ will
place complete and incomplete downloads, options that control the
maximum simultaneous downloads, and information on the public hub list
that DC++ will use.</p>
<h2>Directories</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt id="defdwnlddir">Default download directory</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_DOWNLOADDIR">
<p>After a download is complete, DC++ tries to move your
just finished file to this directory. The default location of the directory depends on what kind of installation
method used to install DC++. If you used the installer (.exe) then your finished downloads will be placed to a folder
in your Windows user profile. In a typical case the default path of the finished downloads is</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>C:\Users\[your username]\Downloads\</i>
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>If you installed the portable (zip archive) version of DC++ then the finished downloads folder defaults to the
"Downloads\" subdirectory under where the DC++ executable is located. The directory will be automatically created if needed in both cases.</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough disk space for your downloads, have write access to the directory and 
have an appropriate file system if you download large files (note that maximum possible size for a 
file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB).</p>
<p>If the target volume runs out of space, DC++ will keep your downloaded files in the Unfinished Downloads Directory
having renamed them to their original filename.</p>
</dd>
  <dt id="unfdwnlddir">Unfinished downloads directory</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_TEMP_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY">
  <p>All incomplete downloads will be stored in this directory. If you leave it empty, temporary downloads will be stored in the default unfinished files folder. The default location of the Incomplete folder depends on what kind of installation method used to install DC++. If you used the installer (.exe) then your finished downloads will be placed to a folder in your Windows user profile. In a typical case the default path of the unfinished downloads is</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\DC++\Incomplete</i>
		</li>
	</ul>
  
  <p>If you installed the portable (zip archive) version of DC++ then the finished downloads folder defaults to the "Incomplete\" subdirectory under
where the DC++ executable is located. The directory will be automatically created if needed in both cases.</p>
  <p>Make sure you have enough disk space for your unfinished downloads, have write access to the
  directory and have an appropriate file system if you download large files (note that maximum
possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB).
  From version 0.700 on of DC++, the antifragmentation method must always be used for segmented
  downloads to work correctly. Hence DC++ tries to reserve the full space needed for the file when
  starting the download. In case of an error (eg. when the drive that holds your Unfinished
  Downloads runs out of space), you will get an error message going like "Not enough space on the
  disk" even if your target drive does have enough free space!
  Incomplete file names follow the following rule: &lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;.&lt;TTH&gt;.dctmp.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can use the <b>%[targetdrive]</b> variable in order to have
  unfinished download directories in all of your target drives. This way, unfinished download
  directories will be distributed amongst all of your drives, resulting in a smaller chance of
runnig out of disk space.</p>
  <p><u>Example</u>: when %[targetdrive]DCUnfinished\ is set
  as the unfinished downloads directory, DC++ creates incomplete files in E:\DCUnfinished\ when
  you download to any target folder located on drive E: and so on...<br/>
  The %[targetdrive] variable is also useful if you often download larger files to a drive other
  than the one that contains your usual unfinished directory. At the end of a successful download,
  moving a large file from the unfinished folder to its target can be very time and resource
  consuming, especially when moving files to another partition of the same physical drive.</p>

<h2>Limits</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_LIMITS">These settings are to avoid overloading your internet connection with
a large number of simulatenous downloads. However, for both values listed below, certain conditions can result in the
limits not being obeyed. Specifically, up to 3 files that are set
to the 'highest' priority can be transferred while other downloads are
going. File lists and small files (64 kibibytes or
smaller) are queued with 'highest' as their priority. When either
of the limits are hit, DC++ shows <em>"All download slots taken"</em>
next to each source in the status column of the Connections tab.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<dl>
  <dt>Maximum simultaneous downloads (0 = infinite)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_DOWNLOADS">This limits the number of simultaneous downloads.
A value of 0 means no limit. (default: 3)</dd>
  <dt>No new downloads if speed exceeds (KiB/s, 0 = disable)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_DOWNLOAD_MAXSPEED">This is another method of limiting simultaneous downloads,
designed to prevent new downloads if your existing downloads exceed a
specific threshold. It's measured in kibibytes per second, and a
value of zero will disable this limit. <div
 style="font-style: italic;">Note; because of changing download speeds, this is not 100% accurate...</div></dd>
