	<dt>Automatically follow redirects</dt>
	<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_AUTO_FOLLOW">
	A connected hub can send out a redirect request, asking your client to disconnect from the
	current hub in order to join another one. When this setting is enabled, DC++ automatically
	follows these requests and connects to the hubs it has been asked to be redirected to. When
	this setting is disabled, DC++ displays a link one can click on to follow the redirect request.
	Note that DC++ disconnects hubs that have sent a redirect request no matter what.
	</dd>
  <dt>Clear search box after each search</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_CLEAR_SEARCH">After each search, your search terms will be cleared. The last
terms will be accessible through the drop-down. You can set how many terms that you want to save by using <a href="settings_history.html#searchhistory">Search history</a>.</dd>
  <dt id="listdupes">Keep duplicate files in your file list</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_LIST_DUPES">Decides whether to remove duplicate files from your share or to
list them but subtract their size from your total reported share size.
Duplicate files never count towards your share size, no matter what
this is set to.</dd>
  <dt id="registrydchubadc">Register with Windows to handle dchub://, nmdcs://, adc:// and adcs:// URL links</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_URL_HANDLER">When set, DC++ will be the default handler for all dchub://, nmdcs://,
adc:// and adcs:// links. These links can appear on web pages, internet shortcuts on your
computer, or be typed and run as a program from
the Start Menu. Disable this if you prefer for a different
application to handle Direct Connect hub links. Disabling will make
DC++ remove the keys from the Windows registry.
  </dd>
  <dt id="registrymagnet">Register with Windows to handle magnet: URI links</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_MAGNET_REGISTER">When set, DC++ will register itself to handle magnet: links.
These links will let you search the Direct Connect network for a file
matching a given file hash, given that the magnet link contains
information appropriate for the Direct Connect network.
Disabling will make DC++ remove the key from
the Windows registry.
</dd>

<dt>Register with Windows to handle .dcext files</dt>
<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_DCEXT_REGISTER">
Associate DC++ with the .dcext file extension in Windows. Those files are plugins that can be
installed into DC++ to extend its functionality.
</dd>

  <dt>Don't delete file lists when exiting</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_KEEP_LISTS">If this option is disabled, DC++ will delete the contents of the
file list directory, where file lists are stored, when
exiting. However, you can open already downloaded file lists
instead of downloading them again. These file lists have a chance of
being out of date, but for users on slow connections, keeping file
lists can save time. <em>Since the file list isn't curent, don't be
surprised if the files you enqueue to download have been removed by the
user, or moved.</em></dd>

<dt>Allow NAT traversal for connections with passive NMDC users</dt>
<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_ALLOW_NAT_TRAVERSAL">Allow NAT traversal for connections with passive NMDC users.
<em>Disabling this feature can resolve connectivity issues with certain hub softwares.</em></dd>

  <dt id="disconnect">Automatically disconnect users who leave the hub</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_AUTO_KICK">The Direct Connect spirit is all about sharing. You are only
sharing when you are connected to one or more hubs. In the past, users
of questionable integrity and spirit logged onto a hub, selected a
download, and disconnected from the hub again. If everyone did that,
there would be nothing to download. Enable this option to avert that
kind of behaviour. <em>Note that you might need to disable this option
if you're connected to a hub that has a bad connection. The user will
regain his/her slot if he/she reconnects within 10 minutes, but you
might have opened up another slot for another user in the mean time.
This could cause a situation where you have way more upload slots in
use than you selected in the settings. Also, if you quit the hub,
people downloading from you will not be disconnected.</em></dd>
  <dt id="sfvcheck">Enable automatic SFV checking</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SFV_CHECK">Simple File Verification (SFV) is a scheme in which a set of
files are accompanied by a so-called sfv-file which contains CRC32
checksums of each file. If there is an sfv-file included, DC++ will
check that your download is free of corruption and retry the download
that wasn't the case.</dd>
  <dt>Don't send the away message to bots</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_NO_AWAYMSG_TO_BOTS">When in away mode, don't send the away message to users that
appear to be bots. Having this option disabled is very annoying if you
get messages from bots that link chat from multiple users (the most
well known example is the Operator Chat facility found in many hubs).
Users are judged to be bots if they have an empty Connection type. <i>Enable if unsure.</i></dd>

  <dt id="break">Break on first ADLSearch match</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_ADLS_BREAK_ON_FIRST">If you're using the <a href="window_adlsearch.html">ADLSearch</a>
features, keeping this option enabled will make a file show up in only
the first search it matches. If disabled, it may appear multiple times,
if it matches more than one search. <i>Disable
if unsure.</i></dd>
  <dt>Enable safe and compressed transfers</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_COMPRESS_TRANSFERS">When transfering data with a compatible client, DC++ will try to
use ZLIB compression with integrity checks. This uses some CPU cycles,
but can dramatically speed up transfers of uncompressed files as well
as ensure file integrity (reduce the chance of corruption to near zero).<i>Enable if unsure.</i></dd>
  <dt>Accept custom user commands from hub</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_HUB_USER_COMMANDS">This option lets you enable or disable DC++'s ability to retrieve
custom commands from a remote hub. Custom User Commands may show
when you click on the hub's tab, or on a user in the Transfer View,
Search Window, or User List, and can enable you to read the rules,
perform operator functions, interact with hub bots, etcetera.</dd>
  <dt>Send unknown /commands to the hub</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SEND_UNKNOWN_COMMANDS">Enable this to send <a href="chat_commands.html">/commands</a>
that DC++ does not recognize to the hub as normal chat.</dd>
  <dt>Add finished files to share instantly (if shared)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_ADD_FINISHED_INSTANTLY">If you download files directly to a shared directory, enabling
this option will add the files to your share as soon as they're
finished. Searches will return the file, and users can download it. It
will not appear in your file list until the next refresh.</dd>
  <dt>Use CTRL for line history</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_USE_CTRL_FOR_LINE_HISTORY">Press up arrow while holding down CTRL to scroll through line
history. If not enabled, you can still use ALT.</dd>
  <dt>Don't automatically disconnect favorite users who leave the hub</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_AUTO_KICK_NO_FAVS">With this option enabled, and <a href="window_settings_advanced.html#disconnect">Automatically disconnect users who leave the hub</a>, users who are in your <a href="favorite_users.html">Favorite users</a> page are not disconnected.</dd>
  <dt>Use extended menus with icons and titles</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_OWNER_DRAWN_MENUS">Have DC++ draw its own menus, which allows icons and titles to be added. Disable to revert to classic Windows menus.</dd>
  <dt>Use system icons when browsing files (slows browsing down a bit)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_USE_SYSTEM_ICONS">
  Ask Windows Explorer for per-extension file icons rather than using default ones distributed
  with DC++. <i>Turning this option on might reduce file browsing performance.</i>
  </dd>
  <dt>Clickable chat links (disable on Wine)</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CLICKABLE_CHAT_LINKS">
  Pretty link formatting in the chat control. Disable on messed up systems (such as old versions of
  Wine) should chat links fail to show up.
  </dd>
  <dt id="segmented">Enable segmented downloads</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SEGMENTED_DL">With this option enabled, DC++ uses segmented downloading. i.e. it downloads each file in many parts simultaneously from all available sources.</dd>
  <dt id="systemstartup">Start DC++ when Windows starts</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_REGISTER_SYSTEM_STARTUP">With this option enabled, DC++ will start up automatically when Windows starts.</dd>
  <dt>Show testing release announcements and information</dt>
  <dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_DISPLAY_TESTING_NAGS">
  Display occasional announcements of available new testing versions (that has not yet been marked as stable by the DC++ team) at startup as well as show bug reporting / etc. information when you're currently using a testing version of DC++.
