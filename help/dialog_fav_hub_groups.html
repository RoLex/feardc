	<h1>Favorite hub groups</h1>
	<p>Favorite hub groups help organize favorite hubs and set global properties onto them. They appear as sub-menus when using the arrow next to the <placeholder><a href="window_main.html#tb_favhubs">Favorite Hubs</a></placeholder> toolbar button. They are also used in the <placeholder><a href="window_main.html#connectfavgroup">Connect to a favorite hub group</a></placeholder>, <placeholder><a href="window_main.html#closefavgroup">Close all hubs of a favorite group</a></placeholder> and <placeholder><a href="window_main.html#closenotfavgroup">Close hubs not in a favorite group</a></placeholder> commands of the main "Window" menu.</p>

	<p cshelp="IDH_FAV_HUB_GROUPS_LIST">Lists currently defined favorite hub groups.</p>
	<h3>Update</h3>
	<p cshelp="IDH_FAV_HUB_GROUPS_UPDATE">Update the currently selected group by changing its properties as defined in the <placeholder><a href="#properties">Group properties</a></placeholder> portion of this dialog.</p>
