    <h1>What do the DC++-style tags mean?</h1>

    <h2>Notation</h2>The following information appears in the
    <a href="window_hub.html#userlistcolumns">Tag column</a> for every
    user in the user list of the <a href="window_hub.html">Hub window</a>:
    &lt;++ V:x,M:x,H:x/y/z,S:x[,O:x]&gt;, where<br/>

    <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">
        <dl>
            <dt>V(ersion)</dt>

            <dd>x = client version</dd>

            <dt>M(ode)</dt>

            <dd>x = mode (A = Active, P = Passive, 5 = SOCKS5)</dd>

            <dt>H(ubs)</dt>

            <dd>x = number of hubs connected to where you're not a
            registered user<br/>
            y = number of hubs you're registered in<br/>
            z = number of hubs you're registered as an
            operator</dd>

            <dt>S(lots)</dt>

            <dd>x = number of upload slots you have open (note that
            they may be in use already)</dd>

            <dt>O(pen an extra slot if speed is below)</dt>

            <dd>x = if total upload is below this value DC++ will
            open another slot<br/>
            This part of the tag is only shown when the option for
            it is enabled.</dd>
        </dl>
    </div>
    The tag is updated every 1-2 minutes if there are changes. 
    Other clients may introduce more tag elements such as L:x
    or B:x which means usage of upload bandwidth limiter where
    x is the amount of maximal upload bandwidth in KiBs.

    <h2>History</h2>The DC++ tag was introduced back when the only
    available Direct Connect client was Neo-Modus DirectConnect
    (NMDC) v1.0. That particular client could only connect to one
    hub at a time, which ensured that the upload slots available
    were assigned to other users connected to that hub. At first,
    hub owners considered DC++ to be a cheat client, because it
    could connect to multiple hubs at once. The DC++ tag was
    introduced so hub owners could check if the users were
    connected to a reasonable amount of hubs and had enough upload
    slots available for sharing.<br/>
    At this point, almost every client, whether it's capable of
    joining multiple hubs or not, has a similar tag in it's
    description field. The custom is to replace "++" with some
    other identifier uniquely identifying the client type (common
    are "StrgDC++", "ApexDC++" and "RSX++").
