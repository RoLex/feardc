<h1>System log</h1>
<p>This window displays important and current information about DC++ and your interactions with the program. If DC++ behaves unexpectedly, you can look in this window for a possible explanation.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of messages can appear in the System log : <u>events</u> and <u>errors</u>. While the first kind of messages are usual, you may want to pay more attention to the latter ones. Error messages shown in the log may come from some failed automatic operation or as a result of your latest interaction with the program interface. The very last message entry in the log is shown in the statusbar of the main DC++ window. You can check the tooltip of the status bar for the last few log entries.</p>
<p>Note that <i>not all</i> error messages appear in the System log. Some windows (like Download Queue or Search) have their own functional status bar and messages related to those windows may appear only on their own place.</p> 

<h2>Context menu commands</h2>

<p>Messages may contain path of file(s) associated with them. The path appears between &lt;brackets&gt; and a right click in it will bring up a context menu with possibility to open/check the particular file in Windows Explorer.</p>
<!--#include virtual="commands_file_general.inc" -->
<!--#include virtual="commands_file_management.inc" -->
<p>If the current selection is not a path to a file then above basic text selection and copy to clipboard commands the following search related commands will appear in the menu:</p>
<!--#include virtual="commands_search.inc" -->


<h2>Event messages</h2>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>File list refresh initiated</dt>
	<dd>This message means that shared folders has been started to check for new or changed files. The process can be initiated automatically (once at startup and then periodically according to the <a href="settings_expert.html#autorefresh">Auto file list refresh</a> setting) or manually by the Refresh file list menu command in the <a href="window_main.html#filemenu">File menu</a>. The new or changed content will be (re)hashed and a log entry will
	be added for each hashed file (see below).</dd>
	<dt>File list refresh finished</dt>
	<dd>This indicates an end of the current hashing procedure. As long as your shared files remain unchaged the filelist reflects the current state of your share.</dd>
	<dt>File list [path] generated</dt>
	<dd>A new file containing your own file list has just been generated. Own file lists are created before the first upload request.</dd>
	<dt>Finished hashing: [path] ([size] at [speed])</dt>
	<dd>Shown for each successfully hashed file including the full path, filesize and hashing speed. Speed value may won't be added for small files.</dd>
	<dt>[Nick]: matched [x] files</dt>
	<dd>This message is shown when someone's filelist has just matched to your queue. [x] shows the number of found matches.</dd>
	<dt>The queued file %1% already exists in your share, removing from the queue</dt>
	<dd>You have the <a href="settings_queue.html#alreadyshared">Don't download files already in share</a> setting enabled and tried to download an already shared file. The operation was prevented accordingly.</dd>
	<dt>Duplicate file will not be shared: [path1] (Size: [size]) Dupe matched against: [path2]</dt>
	<dd>This means that since you have <a href="settings_advanced.html#listdupes">Keep duplicate files in your file list</a>
	setting disabled, a file ([path1]) beeing indexed and already shared (as [path2]) won't be added to your share again.</dd>
	<dt>Hash database rebuild has been scheduled</dt>
	<dd>A <a href="chat_commands.html">/rebuild</a> command received while the hashing process was paused. The hash database will be rebuilt once hashing is resumed.</dd>
	<dt>Hash database rebuilt</dt>
	<dd>Informs you about the finish of a full hash database rebuilding process which can be initiated by the <a href="chat_commands.html">/rebuild</a> chat command</dd>
	<dt>Disconnected user leaving the hub: [nick]</dt>
	<dd>You have <a href="settings_advanced.html#disconnect">Automatically disconnect users who leave the hub</a> setting enabled and this message informs you about its effect.</dd>
	<dt>MAGNET Link detected: [link]</dt>
	<dd>The client received a <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrymagnet">magnet link</a> handle request.</dd>
	<dt>Generated new TLS certificate</dt>
	<dd>As <a href="settings_certs.html">Security certificates</a> enabled but no existing TLS certificate files found (or they are invalid), new certificate files generated in the 'Certificates' subfolder of the directory where DC++ configuraton files are stored.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Successfully created port mappings (Transfers: [port1], Searches: [port2], Encrypted transfers: [port3]) on the [router name] device with the [interface identification] interface</dt>
	<dd>DC++ has managed to automatically create port forwarding rules on the router using <a href="faq_mapping.html">NAT-PMP or UPnP</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Successfully removed port mappings from the [router name] device with the [interface identification] interface</dt>
	<dd>DC++ has managed to remove the existing port forwarding rules from the router made by <a href="faq_mapping.html">NAT-PMP or UPnP</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Determining the best connectivity settings...</dt>
	<dd>This message signals that <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> has started.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Public IP address detected, selecting active mode with direct connection</dt>
	<dd>It means that <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> determined that you have a public IP address so it assumed that you are directly connected to the Internet.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Local network with possible NAT detected, trying to map the ports...</dt>
	<dd><a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> determined that you have a <a href="non-routable.html">private</a> IP address and it started to discover for a possible gateway (router) capable of automatic port mapping.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Active mode could not be achieved; a manual configuration is recommended for better connectivity</dt>
	<dd><a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> did not find any way to configure any kind of active connection so as a last resort it selected passive connection mode with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal" target="_blank" class="external">NAT traversal</a> capability.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Error messages</h2>
<p>Some errors shown in the log contain additional system messages provided by the operating system. These messages usually tell you more about the exact problem; they are marked as [error message] in the description of possible logged errors below. Note that system messages are always shown in the language of your operating system even if you have chosen another one for DC++.</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<dt>Error registering dchub:// link handler</dt>
	<dt>Error registering nmdcs:// link handler</dt>
	<dt>Error registering adc(s):// link handler</dt>
	<dt>Error registering Magnet link handler</dt>
	<dd>These errors mean that DC++ was unable to register the appropriate link handler(s) in Windows, per the <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrymagnet">Register with Windows to handle magnet: URI links</a> and <a href="settings_advanced.html#registrydchubadc">Register with Windows to handle dchub://, nmdcs://, adc:// and adcs:// URL links</a> settings. The most common reason of an unsuccesful registration is that the user account under which DC++ is running does not have appropriate rights for (write) access the required parts of the Windows Registry.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Failed to get external IP</dt>
	<dd>This error message can appear when DC++ tries to map ports for incoming connections via NAT-PMP / UPnP and means that although port mappings were successful, DC++ couldn't get the external IP address from the gateway (router) device. If this message persists, it may be because of broken NAT-PMP / UPnP support of the device. This is not very important, since DC++ can still gather the external IP from connected hubs <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#noipoverride">if it is allowed to do so</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Another port mapping attempt is in progress...</dt>
	<dd>This means that an <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> attempt was started too soon (the previous operation has not been finished). Try restarting DC++ if this message persists. If restart DC++ does not help the most probable reason is broken NAT-PMP / UPnP support of your (router) device.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Failed to initalize the [interface identification] interface</dt>
	<dd>DC++ failed to initalize one of its NAT-PMP or UPnP interfaces and will try to use the next one in the row.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Failed to map the [Transfer/Encrypted transfer/Search] port ([port number] [TCP/UDP]) with the [interface identification] interface</dt>
	<dd>The currently used port mapping interface failed to map the shown port. This error message can appear when DC++ tries to map ports for incoming connections via NAT-PMP / UPnP. It means that no compatible device could be found or that the device in question is not responding. DC++ will try to use the next automatic port mapper interface in the row. This message can occur during <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a>, when DC++ is trying to discover a possible NAT-PMP / UPnP device for setting up active mode. This message is a real problem only if you selected the 'Let DC++ configure my router (NAT-PMP / UPnP)' option manually in <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#connection">Incoming connection settings</a>. In this case, refer to the <a href="faq_mapping.html">port mapping FAQ</a> for more information.</dd>
	<dt>Port mapping: Failed to remove port mappings from the [router name] device with the [interface identification] interface</dt>
	<dd>DC++ has failed to remove the existing port forwarding rules from the router made by <a href="faq_mapping.html">NAT-PMP or UPnP</a>. This message can appear at shutdown or during an <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> attempt and it means that existing port mappings created earlier couldn't be removed successfully. If this message persists the most probable reason is broken NAT-PMP / UPnP support of the (router) device.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity: Unable to open TCP/UDP/TLS port(s); connectivity settings must be configured manually</dt>
	<dd>You can get this message only when <a href="settings_connectivity.html#autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</a> is enabled and DC++ failed to open port(s) before trying to determine the available conncetion types. Possible reasons include the choosen port(s) are already occupied by another application or <a href="faq_unblock.html">DC++ is blocked by a software firewall</a>.</dd>
	<dt>The encrypted transfer port cannot be the same as the transfer port, encrypted transfers will be disabled</dt>
	<dd>The two kind of transfers cannot use the same port therfore the secure one had to be disabled. You have to specify different TCP port for the different transfers in the <a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html#connection">Incoming connection settings</a> or review the current <a href="settings_connectivity.html">connectivity setup</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Not listening for connections - please restart DC++</dt>
	<dd>An unrecoverable low level networking error keeps DC++ from listening for connections. Search and download won't work until you restart DC++.</dd>
	<dt>Connectivity error: [error message]</dt>
	<dt>Connectivity restored</dt>
	<dd>Because of a low level networking error DC++ does not listen for file transfer connections. The problem lasts until the next 'Connectivity restored' message.</dd>
	<dt>Search disabled: [error message]</dt>
	<dt>Search enabled again</dt>
	<dd>Because of a low level networking error DC++ does not listen for search results. The problem lasts until the next 'Search enabled again' message.</dd>

	<dt>Failed to load trusted certificate from [path]</dt>
	<dd>There was a problem loading one of the trusted certificate files, its contents are damaged or invalid.</dd>
	<dt>TLS disabled, failed to generate certificate: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>TLS certificate files are missing or could not be opened. DC++ tried to regenrerate them but it wasn't successful, either. Make sure you have write access rights to the 'Certificates' subfolder of the directory where DC++ configuraton files are stored.</dd>
	<dt>TLS disabled, no certificate file set</dt>
	<dd>TLS can't be used because no certificate files set. You should set or generate them properly in the <a href="settings_certs.html">Security &amp; certificates</a> page.</dd>
	<dt>Certificate verification for [CA name] failed with error: [error message] (certificate KeyPrint: [keyprint])</dt>
	<dd>The security certificate verification of user or hub with keyprint [keyprint] has failed because of [error message].</dd>
	<dt>CRC32 inconsistency (SFV-Check) : [path]</dt>
	<dd>You have <a href="settings_advanced.html#sfvcheck">automatic SFV checking enabled</a> and a downloaded file is not passed the SFV-check. The file will be downloaded again.</dd>
	<dt>File list refresh in progress, please wait for it to finish before trying to refresh again</dt>
	<dd>Only one file list refreshing operation can be run at the same time.</dd>

	<dt>Error creating hash data file: [error message]</dt>
	<dd>Error when creating hash data file (HashData.dat). This message may indicate issues accessing the <a href="faq_settings_files.html">settings folder or files</a>.</dd>
	<dt>[path] not shared; calculated CRC32 does not match the one found in SFV file.</dt>
	<dd>Before sharing files DC++ will automatically check them against an .SFV file (if one exists in the same directory) to make sure that no corrupted files will be shared. If you get this error then either your file(s) are corrupted or the control data in the corresponding .SFV file is outdated or damaged.</dd>
	<dt>Unable to move [path1] to [path2] ([error message]); renamed to [path3]</dt>
	<dd>Moving a finished download [path1] from the unfinished downloads folder to its target place [path2] wasn't successful because of [error message] so the file is left in the unfinished downloads folder and renamed to its orginal name ([path3]).</dd>
