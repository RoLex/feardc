<p>This window shows the list of all users of the hubs you connected in the current DC++ session as well as all the detailed information associated with every listed user. It's possible to quickly find any online user from any connected hub and easily keep track of your favorite users, too. With its powerful filtering capabilities this window provides the functionality of the former Favorite Users and Waiting Users window.</p>

<h2>Details pane (right)</h2>
<p cshelp="IDH_USERS_DETAILS">
	This pane shows you all the available details sent by the DC client of the selected user. The number of records shown can heavily depend on what kind of user selected, what protocol it uses, etc... For example you can get the most information from an ADC client user while the amount of available information from a hub bot is usually very small.
	The content displayed in the pane is selectable and there's a right click menu function which allows you to select all the data and / or to copy the selection to the clipboard.
</p>

<h2>Filters (bottom)</h2>
<p>The user list can be filtered by text, online status and file transfer activity. The following options are available:</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <dt>Text filter</dt>
  <dd>
	<p cshelp="IDH_USERS_FILTER">
	<!--#include virtual="window_list_filter.inc" -->

		"foo" in their nick.
