	<h1>Connectivity</h1>

	<h2 id="autoconn">Automatic connectivity setup</h2>
	<p>
	Connectivity settings must be correctly configured for searches and downloads to work. In most
	cases, DC++ is able to detect the best connectivity settings by itself. When it can't (for
	example, when multiple network cards are available or when the network topology is too
	complicated), the various connectivity settings can still be manually adjusted from the
	<placeholder><a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html">Manual configuration</a></placeholder>
	page.

		<dt>Let DC++ determine the best connectivity settings</dt>
		<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_AUTODETECT">
		Select this to let DC++ determine the best connectivity settings on your behalf. This
		should work with the majority of network structures DC++ is generally used in. The success
		rate depends on operating system configuration and on the network topology.<br/>
		Note that when this option is active, <u>manual connectivity settings will be ignored</u>.
		<p>It is recommended to disable this option and to manually set up connectivity settings
		when the network topology is not easy for DC++ to figure out, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>When there is more than one physical network device (eg. network cards, 3G USB
			modems) plugged in the computer (the bind address will have to be fiddled with).</li>
			<li>In the presence of network tunneling, a
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank" class="external">VPN</a>
			service or any other software that creates virtual network devices.</li>
			<li>When DC++ is only supposed to connect to local network hubs (eg. in a campus).</li>
		</ul>

		<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_DETECT_NOW">
		With this button, you can force DC++ to (re)detect the best connectivity settings. Details
		and the result of the operation will be shown in the "Detection log" box below.

		<dt>Detection log</dt>
		<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_DETECTION_LOG">
		This box contains log messages of the last connectivity auto-detection. It contains the
		detection steps, possible error messages and shows why a certain connection mode was
		chosen. This information is helpful in case of errors or when the result is other than
		expected. Detection messages appear in the
		<placeholder><a href="window_system_log.html">System Log</a></placeholder> as well;
		descriptions of the various messages are available in the
		<a href="window_system_log.html">list of System log messages</a>.
		</dd>

		<dt>Edit detected settings</dt>
		<dd cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_CONNECTIVITY_EDIT">
		Press this button to customize the connectivity settings that DC++ has automatically
		detected. Connectivity auto-detection will be disabled, in favor of manually configured
		settings. The dialog will switch to the
		<placeholder><a href="settings_connectivity_manual.html">Manual configuration</a></placeholder>
		page, in which the currently auto-detected connectivity settings will have been filled.
		Note that for the time being DC++ attempts to detect IPv4 connectivity only.
