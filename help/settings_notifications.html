	<h2>Play a sound</h2>
	<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NOTIFICATIONS_SOUND">
	Checking this box will turn sound notifications on for the selected event. The system's default
	beep sound will be used by default unless a custom one is assigned from the
	"<placeholder>Notification sound</placeholder>" group.<br/>
	This box can be switched by double-clicking the sound icon in the "Sound" column of the desired
	event.
	</p>

	<h2>Display a balloon popup</h2>
	<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NOTIFICATIONS_BALLOON">
	Checking this box will turn balloon popup notifications on for the selected event. An example
	of such a balloon can be previewed by pressing the
	"<placeholder>Fire a balloon popup example</placeholder>" button.<br/>
	This box can be switched by double-clicking the balloon icon in the "Balloon" column of the
	desired event.

	Instead of the system's default beep, a custom sound can be assigned to each event by selecting
	the desired event in the "Notifications" list, enabling the "Sound" icon, then clicking the
	"Browse..." button. Only Wave sound files (typically with a ".wav" extension) are allowed.

	<h2>Balloon settings</h2>
	<h3>Display the balloon only when DC++ is in the background</h3>
	<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NOTIFICATIONS_BALLOON_BG">
	When this box is checked, balloons popups will fire to signal the selected event only when DC++
	is in the background (either minimized or not the active window). Otherwise, they will always
	be displayed whenever the selected event is signalled.
	</p>

	<h2>Fire a balloon popup example</h2>
	<p cshelp="IDH_SETTINGS_NOTIFICATIONS_BALLOON_EXAMPLE">
	Pressing this button will have DC++ launch a balloon popup example from the Windows
	notification area. The balloon popup will be titled
	"<i>DC++ - <placeholder>Balloon popup example</placeholder></i>" and will contain the following
	string as its content text:
	"<i><placeholder>This is an example of a balloon popup notification!</placeholder></i>".
