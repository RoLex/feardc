0) Requirements
---------------

Refer to the ``Compile.txt`` file for requirements.


1) Creating translation templates
---------------------------------

Refer to the "1) Creating translation templates" section of the ``Translations.txt`` file.

This step should occur about **1 week** before the actual release.


2) Updating translations
------------------------

Refer to the "2) Updating translations" section of the ``Translations.txt`` file.


3) Version update
-----------------

Update version numbers in:

- ``dcpp/version.h``

- ``win32/DCPlusPlus.rc``


4) Changelog update
-------------------

Set the first line of the ``changelog_feardc.txt`` file to refer to the new version. Example:

    -- 0.851 2015-04-06 --


5) Tag the repository
---------------------

Tag the repository according to the version number. Example:

    hg tag 0.860


6) Distro build (in 2 steps)
----------------------------

Ensure your repo is clean (no ``.sconsign.dblite`` file; no ``build`` directory) and
also that all the files required but cannot be added to the repo are all present 
(e.g. HTMLHelp includes and libs) then:

- Build the x64 version:

    scons arch=x64 mode=release

- Build the rest (the x64 version built above will be included in generated packages):

    scons distro=1


7) Check and rename the files
-----------------------------

The ``build/distro`` directory should contain 4 files; check their contents:

- ``DCPlusPlus-xxx.exe``: 32-bit **and** 64-bit installer. Ensure it runs fine.

- ``DCPlusPlus-xxx.zip``: 32-bit binary arche. Should contain 8 regular files and a ``locale``
  directory with 5 files per language.

- ``DCPlusPlus-xxx-x64.zip``: 64-bit binary arche. Should contain 8 regular files and a ``locale``
  directory with 5 files per language.

- ``DCPlusPlus-xxx-src.zip``: Source code. Should be a direct extract of the FearDC repository.

**Don't forget to replace the "xxx" parts of the file names with the actual version number.**


8) Upload the files
-------------------

- Upload these 4 files to the sourceforge project, with the method of your choice (I prefer via FTP).

- Make a pass on their details once they are uploaded to indicate what they are, targeted
  platforms, etc.


9) Update the web site
----------------------

- Mention the new version in the ``download.html`` page of the web site. The new version should be
  marked as "testing".

- The build step should also have generated ``build/webhelp``, which can be uploaded as is to the
  corresponding directory of the FearDC website.


10) Update launchpad bugs
-------------------------

Update launchpad bugs from "Fix Committed" to "Fix Released", either by hand or by using the
``scripts/commited_released.py`` script.


11) Update version.xml
----------------------

Add / uncomment the <Testingxx> parts of the ``version.xml`` file stored by the web site to
start offering the testing release for a small subset of the userbase.


12) Testing -> Stable status
----------------------------

After some time (usually a week or two), the testing version can be considered stable.

- Update the web site - ``download.html`` and ``index.html`` pages.

- Update the ``version.xml`` file stored by the web site with the new stable version number.
  Also remove / uncomment the <Testingxx> parts of the file until / unless there's a new version
  marked as ``Testing``.

- Mark the new stable installer as the preferred download on Windows.
