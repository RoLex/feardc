FearDC translation process
========================

This document briefly describes the FearDC translation process.
Translations currently happen in Launchpad <https://translations.launchpad.net/dcplusplus>.

1) Creating translation templates
2) Updating translations


1) Creating translation templates
---------------------------------

Translation templates are .pot files. They're stored as Unix-type text files in the repo. Therefore it's best to produce them
using a Unix/like environment such as Cygwin (perl and gettext-devel packages need to be installed).
Templates produced on Windows needs to be flipped to Unix format before committing.

First, clean up with::

	scons -c help=1 i18n=1 dcpp/po/libdcpp.pot help/po/dcpp-help.pot installer/po/dcpp-installer.pot win32/po/dcpp-win32.pot

Then build translation templates with::

	scons help=1 i18n=1 dcpp/po/libdcpp.pot help/po/dcpp-help.pot installer/po/dcpp-installer.pot win32/po/dcpp-win32.pot

Commit them with::

	hg ci -m "Update translation templates"
	hg push

Copy the files to the Bazaar repository at Launchpad and commit them with::

	bzr ci -m "Update translation templates"
	bzr push

Launchpad should then update the translation templates by itself. Follow the import status on
<https://translations.launchpad.net/dcplusplus/+imports>; once all translation templates are marked
as "Imported", announce translations are ready by providing links to
<https://translations.launchpad.net/dcplusplus>:

	- Send a message to <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dcplusplus-devel>.


2) Updating translations
------------------------

Download PO files from <https://translations.launchpad.net/dcplusplus/trunk/+export>.

Extract them to a directory, say C:/trans.

Open a Cygwin command prompt in the scripts directory of the FearDC repo. Merge new translations::

	./update-languages.sh C:/trans

[If running scons from Cygwin is a problem, temporarily remove the scons call in
update-languages.sh, call that scons command manually then run the script.]

Check updated and new translations with::

	hg status

Ensure new translations are correct (recently updated). Use "hg add" to add them if they are;
otherwise, delete them.

Make sure updated languages build fine; eg for the "fr" language::

	scons i18n=1 build/debug-mingw/bin/locale/fr

Should there be errors, it is usually just a matter of a mis-matched tag, missing placeholder or
some such. No need to interrupt the whole process in that case; fix / delete the translation in 2
places: 1) the relevant ``.po`` file; 2) on the Launchpad translation interface.

Commit new translations::

	hg ci
	hg push


vim: set filetype=rst:
